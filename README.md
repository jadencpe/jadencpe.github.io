Hi, I‚Äôm Jaden, and I am a firm believer in the resurrection of Pierce The Veil, and its impending rise back into fame.
I‚Äôm interested in Vic Fuentes, I am a Vic Supremacist, I believe in Fuentes Supremacy.
In the name of the father vic, the son, gerard, and the holy spirit, jonathan davis... amen.
I‚Äôm currently learning every pierce the veil song known to man (the acoustic version) on the guitar.
üíûÔ∏è Pfft, love? Romance? It's a sham anyway, do I look like I have the time for that non-sense? cough cough kilala niyo kung sino kayo.
Just focus on studying, yk? I'm kidding, I am absolutely, mind-numbingly desperate, a hopeless romantic.
How to reach me ... to reach me is very easy, all you have to do is bend down a little.
oke that is all bye bye^^

Jonathan Davis is a traumatized icon. No matter how many times I hear "pretty"  and "daddy", two of the most gut-wrenching, nausea-inducing, tear-jerking songs i have ever heard in my entire life, i will never get sick of jonathan's singing. he could boom na  da umm na name urrata int ta um in my ear and i would dance along while my eardrops slowly expand and crack and bleed.

Man, at this point i think im just inlove with a man thats about 3 decades older than me. its like the book "lolita" except in this case, charlotte is *actually* committed instead of just being a re-iteration and the delusions of humbert. goddamn i just cant help it look at this dude lord fuentesquaad.

GOOODDDDD THEIR SONGS ARE SO GOOD I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THEM ENOUGH. Everytime i hear any one of their songs i start screaming, crying, throwing up, banging my head against a concrete wall, devouring my intestines out, sawing my head off, blood bubbling out of my mouth, gurgling my larynx out while i slowly go insane and bash my skull out so much it turns into a powder, which i would use as babypowder to stop the tears.
JUSTLOOK AT THIS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
