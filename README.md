Hello, I’m Jaden, and I am a firm believer in the resurrection of Pierce The Veil, and its impending rise back into fame.
Before we begin with my introduction, let us pray...

[The New National Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfL9tSCA9A)

In the name of the father vic, the son, gerard, and the holy spirit, jonathan davis... amen.

I’m currently learning every pierce the veil song known to man (the acoustic version) on the guitar.



## ***HERE IS A LIST OF REASONS WHY I LOVE PTV AND KORN***

### **KORN**

Jonathan Davis is a traumatized icon. No matter how many times I hear "pretty"  and "daddy", two of the most gut-wrenching, nausea-inducing, tear-jerking songs i have ever heard in my entire life, i will never get sick of jonathan's singing. he could boom na  da umm na name urrata int ta um in my ear and i would dance along while my eardrops slowly expand and crack and bleed.

#### **PIERCE THE VEIL**

Man, at this point i think im just inlove with a man thats about 3 decades older than me. its like the book "lolita" except in this case, charlotte is *actually* committed instead of just being a re-iteration and the delusions of humbert. goddamn i just cant help it look at this dude lord fuentesquaad. *Just to reassure you, I am saying all of this satirically. This is all simply for entertainment purposes.*

**GOD**, their songs are *SO GOOD*.

Everytime i hear any one of their songs i start screaming, crying, throwing up, banging my head against a concrete wall, devouring my intestines out, sawing my head off, blood bubbling out of my mouth, gurgling my larynx out while i slowly go insane and bash my skull out so much it turns into a powder, which i would use as babypowder to stop the tears.
**LOOK AT THIS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA**

I have more to say but, I'm afraid nobody would take the time and effort to go through all the pent up love and devotion I have for these bands. So, I bid all of you farewell.
